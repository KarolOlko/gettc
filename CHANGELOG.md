This document is useful to both developers and users who may be curious to know 
what has changed after an update. By the way, you can update just by
`[sudo] gem install gettc` or `[sudo] gem update` (which will update all gems). 

Updating is usually backward-compatible, which means that the problems generated
by an older version should continue to work after an update.

As of version 1.6 and onward, gettc will replace the contents in `$GETTC_HOME`
(defaults to `~/.gettc`) if they are outdated. If you are a power user and you 
make heavy customisation in your `$GETTC_HOME`, make sure to back up before
updating.
