Gettc's Javascript plugin to generate Javascript solutions for TopCoder problems.

## User requirements

You need Node.js. I recommend a version of at least v.0.12.2.
You also need the following NPM packages:

* `npm install long -g` Because many TopCoder problems deal with 64bit integers.

## Known issues

If you're on Windows and you get an error like `cannot execute checker`, you can
fix by deleting or commenting the line `delegate` in `runner.sh` (line 132). To
make the change permanent, apply the fix in `~/.gettc/template/bin/runner.sh`.

If you have a nicer solution, please send me an email.
