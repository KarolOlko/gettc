## Developement guide

The following guide is for internal developement only.

These days the Java community has apparently moved away from Ant. Maven or
Gradle is the way to go now. Eventually we will have to migrate but before 
then, follow these instructions to run stuffs:

1. Download [junit-4.10.jar](http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g:"junit" AND a:"junit). 
Mind the version number. Last time I checked, things didn't work for junit 4.11.
2. Download [hamcrest-core-1.3.jar](http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g:"org.hamcrest" AND a:"hamcrest-core").
3. Put both the jars into Ant lib, which should be `usr/share/ant/lib` on Linux.
