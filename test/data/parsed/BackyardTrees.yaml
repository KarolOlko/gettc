statement: "This problem statement contains images that may not display properly if
  viewed outside of the applet.\n\nYour backyard is a rectangular grid that measures
  *width* x *height* square meters.  You would like to plant *treeCount* trees using
  the following rules: \n\n\t- All trees must be planted at integer coordinates on
  the grid.\n\n\t- All trees must lie on the same straight line.\n\n\t- Each pair
  of trees must be at least *distance* meters away from each other.\n\nFor example,
  two (of many) ways in which four trees could be planted on a 10x10 grid if *distance*
  is 2 are depicted below:\n\n![image](images/BackyardTrees1.png)   ![image](images/BackyardTrees2.png)\n\nReturn
  the number of distinct ways in which the trees could be planted, modulo 1,000,000,000.
  \ Two layouts are considered distinct if there exists a point (x, y) such that one
  layout contains a tree at (x, y) and the other layout does not."
definitions:
  Class: BackyardTrees
  Method: countWays
  Parameters: int, int, int, int
  Returns: int
  Method signature: int countWays(int treeCount, int width, int height, int distance)

constraints:
- "*treeCount* will be between 1 and 50, inclusive."
- "*width* will be between 1 and 500, inclusive."
- "*height* will be between 1 and 500, inclusive."
- "*distance* will be between 1 and 50, inclusive."
examples:
- !ruby/object:Gettc::Case
  input: |-
    2,
    4,
    4,
    1
  output: '300'
  reason: There are only two trees, and the distance between any two points with integer
    coordinates is always at least 1.  Therefore, you can place the two trees at any
    two points with integer coordinates.  There are 25 such points and this gives
    you 300 different ways to plant the trees.
- !ruby/object:Gettc::Case
  input: |-
    13,
    36,
    48,
    5
  output: '2'
  reason: The diagonal of the backyard has a length of 60, which is just enough to
    place 13 trees with a distance of 5 between each adjacent pair.  Luckily, these
    13 points are at integer coordinates, so you can place the trees along either
    of the two diagonals while satisfying all the rules.
- !ruby/object:Gettc::Case
  input: |-
    5,
    5,
    5,
    1
  output: '88'
  reason: ''
- !ruby/object:Gettc::Case
  input: |-
    50,
    49,
    49,
    1
  output: '102'
  reason: You can place the trees along the rows or the columns of the grid, as well
    as on the two diagonals.
- !ruby/object:Gettc::Case
  input: |-
    6,
    5,
    5,
    2
  output: '0'
  reason: You can't plant 6 trees on the same line with the necessary distance between
    them on this grid.
